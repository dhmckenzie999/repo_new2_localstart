The Golfo Dulce, is one of the most pristine tropical fjords in the world. It is surrounded by lush mountainous rainforest and mangrove wetlands. The gulf is approximately 50 km’s long and it takes nearly half an hour by boat to reach its far shore (15 km’s). It is also the only known place in the world where the migration paths of whales from both the northern and southern hemispheres cross over as they give birth to their young in a gulf that provides sanctuary for their young calves. Whale sharks also aggregate in Golfo Dulce along with the many resident dolphins and more than 25 species of whales that either migrate through the area or live in the area permanently.
