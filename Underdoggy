When criminals in this world appear,
And break the laws that they should fear,
And frighten all who see or hear,
The cry goes up both far and near for
Underdog,
Underdog,
Underdog,
Underdog.

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder*,
Fighting all who rob or plunder
Underdog, Underdog, Underdog.



Full Version:


There's no need to fear, Underdog is here.

When criminals in this world appear,
And break the laws that they should fear,
And frighten all who see or hear,
The cry goes up both far and near for
Underdog,
Underdog,
Underdog,
Underdog.

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder,
Fighting all who rob or plunder
Underdog, Underdog, Underdog.

When in this world the headlines read
Of those whose hearts are filled with greed
And rob and steal from those in need.
To right this wrong with blinding speed goes
Underdog,
Underdog,
Underdog,
Underdog.

Speed of lightning, roar of thunder,
Fighting all who rob or plunder
Underdog, Underdog, Underdog.

(*There were two versions of the chorus,
"Roar of thunder" and "Power of thunder".

The theme featuring a giant rampaging through the city was "power of thunder"; those featuring Riff Raff and Simon Bar Sinister were "roar of thunder".)
